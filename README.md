# Learning to Rank Playground
This repository contains my experiments on two datasets, [KGRec: Sound and Music Recommendation with Knowledge Graphs](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/kgrec), methodology available in this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2926718) (_behind a paywall, but available for free somewhere I'm sure_), and [LFM-1b](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/), methodology available in this [paper](http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/Research/Publications/pdf/schedl_icmr_2016.pdf) (_dataset is not up anymore, which implies it is accessible if there was a site that captures snapshots of sites and stores them somewhere by date_).

# What am I trying to learn?
- Train a PyTorch matrix factorization model from scratch
- Train an XGBRanker, CatBoostRanker and LGBMRanker on some notion of meaningful data for hybrid recommendation systems
- Learn how to evaluate
- Use the textual features effectively
- Use uv instead of pip for everything in this project
- _Maybe_ distributed training
